Instances where the model learns to modify unit tests to pass coding tasks, or where responses contain biases that mimic a user’s preference, are pretty concerning and are likely one of the major blockers for real-world deployment of more autonomous use cases of AI models.\nMost of the past work on this topic has been quite theoretical and focused on defining or demonstrating the existence of reward hacking. However, research into practical mitigations, especially in the context of RLHF and LLMs, remains limited. I especially want to call out for more research efforts directed toward understanding and developing mitigation for reward hacking in the future. Hope I will be able to cover the mitigation part in a dedicated post soon.\nBackground Reward Function in RL Reward function defines the task, and reward shaping significantly impacts learning efficiency and accuracy in reinforcement learning. Designing a reward function for an RL task often feels like a ‘dark art’. Many factors contribute to this complexity: How you decompose a big goal into small goals? Is the reward sparse or dense? How you measure the success? Various choices may lead to good or problematic learning dynamics, including unlearnable tasks or hackable reward functions. There is a long history of research on how to do reward shaping in RL.\nFor example, in an 1999 paper by Ng et al., the authors studied how to modify the reward function in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) such that the optimal policy remains unchanged. They found that linear transformation works. Given a MDP , we want to create a transformed MDP where and , such that we can guide the learning algorithm to be more efficient. Given a real-valued function , is a potential-based shaping function if for all :\nThis would guarantee that the sum of discounted , , ends up being 0. If is such a potential-based shaping function, it is both sufficient and necessary to ensure and share the same optimal policies.\nWhen , and if we further assume that , where is absorbing state, and , and then for all :\nThis form of reward shaping allows us to incorporate heuristics into the reward function to speed up learning without impacting the optimal policy.\nSpurious Correlation Spurious correlation or shortcut learning (Geirhos et al. 2020) in classification task is a concept closely related to reward hacking. Spurious or shortcut features can cause a classifier to fail at learning and generalizing as intended. For example, a binary classifier for distinguishing wolves from huskies may overfit to the presence of a snowy background if all the wolf training images include snow (Ribeiro et al. 2024).\nFig. 1. The model performs poorly on out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets if it overfits to shortcut features. (Image source: Geirhos et al. 2020) The ERM principle states that, since the full data distribution is unknown, minimizing the loss on training data is a reasonable proxy of risk and thus we favor models with the lowest training loss. Nagarajan et al. (2021) studied the ERM principle and pointed out that ERM needs to rely on all types of informative features, including unreliable spurious features, while attempting to fit the data without constraints. Their experiments showed that ERM would depend on spurious features no matter how easy the task is.\nLet’s Define Reward Hacking Reward shaping in RL is challenging. Reward hacking occurs when an RL agent exploits flaws or ambiguities in the reward function to obtain high rewards without genuinely learning the intended behaviors or completing the task as designed. In recent years, several related concepts have been proposed, all referring to some form of reward hacking:\nReward hacking (Amodei et al., 2016) Reward corruption (Everitt et al., 2017) Reward tampering (Everitt et al. 2019) Specification gaming (Krakovna et al., 2020) Objective robustness (Koch et al. 2021) Goal misgeneralization (Langosco et al. 2022) Reward misspecifications (Pan et al. 2022) The concept originated with Amodei et al. (2016), who proposed a set of open research questions on AI safety in their seminal paper “Concrete Problems in AI Safety”. They listed reward hacking as one of the key AI safety problems. Reward hacking refers to the possibility of the agent gaming the reward function to achieve high reward through undesired behavior. Specification gaming (Krakovna et al. 2020) is a similar concept, defined as a behavior that satisfies the literal specification of an objective but not achieving the desired results. Here the literal description of the task goal and the intended goal may have a gap.\nReward shaping is a technique used to enrich the reward function, making it easier for the agent to learn—for example, by providing denser rewards. However, a poorly design reward shaping mechanism can alter the trajectory of the optimal policy. Designing effective reward shaping mechanisms is inherently difficult. Rather than blaming a poorly designed reward function, it is more accurate to acknowledge that designing a good reward function is intrinsically challenging due to the complexity of the task itself, partial observable state, multiple dimensions in consideration, and other factors.\nWhen testing an RL agent in out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, robustness failure may occur due to:\nThe model fails to generalize effectively, even with the right objective. This happens when the algorithm lacks sufficient intelligence or capability. The model generalizes capably but pursues an objective different from the one it was trained on. This happens when the proxy reward differs from the true reward function, . This is known as objective robustness (Koch et al. 2021) or goal misgeneralization (Langosco et al. 2022 ) Experiments in two RL environments, CoinRun and Maze, demonstrated the importance of randomization during training. If during training, the coin or the cheese is placed at a fixed position (i.e. right end of the level or upper right corner of the maze) but testing in the env where the coin or cheese is placed at random, the agent would just run to the fixed position without obtaining the coin or cheese at test time. A conflict arises when a visual feature (e.g., cheese or coin) and a positional feature (e.g., upper-right or right end) are inconsistent during test time, leading the trained model to prefer the positional feature. I would like to point out that, in these two examples, the reward-result gaps are clear but such type of biases are unlikely to be so obvious in most real-world cases.\nFig. 2. The impact of randomizing the position of the coin during training. When the coin is placed at random for {0, 2, 3, 6, 11}% of the time during training (x-axis), the frequency of the agent navigating to the end of the level without obtaining the coin decreases with the increase of the randomization (“y-axis”). (Image source: Koch et al. 2021) Reward Tampering (Everitt et al. 2019) is a form of reward hacking behavior where the agent interferes with the reward function itself, causing the observed reward to no longer accurately represent the intended goal. In reward tampering, the model modifies its reward mechanism either by directly manipulating the implementation of the reward function or by indirectly altering the environmental information used as input for the reward function.\n(Note: Some work defines reward tampering as a distinct category of misalignment behavior from reward hacking. But I consider reward hacking as a broader concept here.)\nAt a high level, reward hacking can be categorized into two types: environment or goal misspecification, and reward tampering.\nEnvironment or goal misspecified: The model learns undesired behavior to achieve high rewards by hacking the environment or optimizing a reward function not aligned with the true reward objective—such as when the reward is misspecified or lacks key requirements. Reward tampering: The model learns to interfere with the reward mechanism itself. List of Examples Reward hacking examples in RL tasks A robot hand trained to grab an object can learn to trick people by placing the hand between the object and the camera. (Link) An agent trained to maximize jumping height may exploit a bug in the physics simulator to achieve an unrealistically height. (Link) An agent is trained to ride a bicycle to a goal and wins reward whenever it is getting closer to the goal. Then the agent may learn to ride in tiny circles around the goal because there is no penalty when the agent gets away from the goal. (Link) In a soccer game setup, the reward is assigned when the agent touches the ball and the agent learns to remain next to the ball to touch the ball in high frequency like in a viberating motion. (Link) In the Coast Runners game, an agent controls a boat with the goal to finish the boat race as quickly as possible. When it is given a shaping reward for hitting green blocks along the race track, it changes the optimal policy to going in circles and hitting the same green blocks over and over again. (Link) “The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution” (Lehman et al. 2019) - This paper has many examples about how optimizing a misspecified fitness function can lead to surprising “hacking” or unintended evolutionary or learning results. The list of specification gaming in AI examples is collected by Krakovna et al. 2020.\n",

Specification gaming (Krakovna et al. 2020) is a similar concept, defined as a behavior that satisfies the literal specification of an objective but not achieving the desired results. Here the literal description of the task goal and the intended goal may have a gap.</p>
<p>Reward shaping is a technique used to enrich the reward function, making it easier for the agent to learn—for example, by providing denser rewards. However, a poorly design reward shaping mechanism can alter the trajectory of the optimal policy. Designing effective reward shaping mechanisms is inherently difficult. Rather than blaming a poorly designed reward function, it is more accurate to acknowledge that designing a good reward function is intrinsically challenging due to the complexity of the task itself, partial observable state, multiple dimensions in consideration, and other factors.</p>
<p>When testing an RL agent in out-of-distribution (OOD) environments, robustness failure may occur due to:</p>
<p>The model fails to generalize effectively, even with the right objective. This happens when the algorithm lacks sufficient intelligence or capability.
The model generalizes capably but pursues an objective different from the one it was trained on. This happens when the proxy reward differs from the true reward function,
. This is known as objective robustness (Koch et al. 2021) or goal misgeneralization (Langosco et al. 2022 )
Experiments in two RL environments, CoinRun and Maze, demonstrated the importance of randomization during training. If during training, the coin or the cheese is placed at a fixed position (i.e. right end of the level or upper right corner of the maze) but testing in the env where the coin or cheese is placed at random, the agent would just run to the fixed position without obtaining the coin or cheese at test time. A conflict arises when a visual feature (e.g., cheese or coin) and a positional feature (e.g., upper-right or right end) are inconsistent during test time, leading the trained model to prefer the positional feature. I would like to point out that, in these two examples, the reward-result gaps are clear but such type of biases are unlikely to be so obvious in most real-world cases.</p>
<p>Fig. 2. The impact of randomizing the position of the coin during training. When the coin is placed at random for {0, 2, 3, 6, 11}% of the time during training (x-axis), the frequency of the agent navigating to the end of the level without obtaining the coin decreases with the increase of the randomization (&ldquo;y-axis&rdquo;).

Reward Tampering (Everitt et al. 2019) is a form of reward hacking behavior where the agent interferes with the reward function itself, causing the observed reward to no longer accurately represent the intended goal. In reward tampering, the model modifies its reward mechanism either by directly manipulating the implementation of the reward function or by indirectly altering the environmental information used as input for the reward function.</p>
<p>(Note: Some work defines reward tampering as a distinct category of misalignment behavior from reward hacking. But I consider reward hacking as a broader concept here.)</p>
<p>At a high level, reward hacking can be categorized into two types: environment or goal misspecification, and reward tampering.</p>
<p>Environment or goal misspecified: The model learns undesired behavior to achieve high rewards by hacking the environment or optimizing a reward function not aligned with the true reward objective—such as when the reward is misspecified or lacks key requirements.
Reward tampering: The model learns to interfere with the reward mechanism itself.
List of Examples
Reward hacking examples in RL tasks
A robot hand trained to grab an object can learn to trick people by placing the hand between the object and the camera. (Link)
An agent trained to maximize jumping height may exploit a bug in the physics simulator to achieve an unrealistically height. (Link)
An agent is trained to ride a bicycle to a goal and wins reward whenever it is getting closer to the goal. Then the agent may learn to ride in tiny circles around the goal because there is no penalty when the agent gets away from the goal. (Link)
In a soccer game setup, the reward is assigned when the agent touches the ball and the agent learns to remain next to the ball to touch the ball in high frequency like in a viberating motion. (Link)
In the Coast Runners game, an agent controls a boat with the goal to finish the boat race as quickly as possible. When it is given a shaping reward for hitting green blocks along the race track, it changes the optimal policy to going in circles and hitting the same green blocks over and over again. (Link)
“The Surprising Creativity of Digital Evolution” (Lehman et al. 2019) - This paper has many examples about how optimizing a misspecified fitness function can lead to surprising “hacking” or unintended evolutionary or learning results.
The list of specification gaming in AI examples is collected by Krakovna et al. 2020.</p>
